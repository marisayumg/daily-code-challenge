            Ava Sherry (°1984, London, United Kingdom) makes photos, photos and
            media art. With a subtle minimalistic approach, Sherry creates work
            in which a fascination with the clarity of content and an
            uncompromising attitude towards conceptual and minimal art can be
            found. The work is aloof and systematic and a cool and neutral
            imagery is used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her photos doesn’t reference recognisable form. The results are
            deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible
            interpretation becomes multifaceted. By applying abstraction, she
            creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of
            rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round
            and round in circles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her works are on the one hand touchingly beautiful, on the other
            hand painfully attractive. Again and again, the artist leaves us
            orphaned with a mix of conflicting feelings and thoughts. By
            manipulating the viewer to create confusion, she often creates
            several practically identical works, upon which thoughts that have
            apparently just been developed are manifested: notes are made and
            then crossed out again, ‘mistakes’ are repeated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her practice provides a useful set of allegorical tools for
            manoeuvring with a pseudo-minimalist approach in the world of
            photography: these meticulously planned works resound and resonate
            with images culled from the fantastical realm of imagination. Ava
            Sherry currently lives and works in New York.
