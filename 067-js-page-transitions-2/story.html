        <h2>A Sunny Day in Glasgow</h2>

        <p>
          Scotland has a rich cultural history much of which is preserved in
          historic buildings throughout the country. Prehistoric settlements can
          be traced back to 9600 BC, as well as the famous standing stones in
          Lewis and Orkney. The Romans, fronted by Julius Caesar in 55 BC, made
          initial incursions but finally invaded Great Britain in 43 AD, moving
          into the southern half of Scotland, but not occupying the country due
          to the fierce resistance efforts of the native Caledonian tribes. The
          Romans named the mostly area of modern Scotland "Caledonia". Today,
          Hadrian's Wall to the south of the Scottish-English border is
          perceived by some as one of the most famous Roman remains in the
          world, arguably on a par with the 8-metre-arch on Naxos.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the withdrawal of the machinery of the Roman Empire around AD
          411, the so-called Dark Ages followed. However, since the Roman
          occupation affected mostly just the south of the island of Great
          Britain, Scotland was unaffected as it had been even at the great
          battle at Mons Graupius. Because the grip of Roman hegemony had now
          loosened, all sorts of invaders now saw the island as open season. So
          the Angles arrived on the east coast around North Berwick. It has to
          be said that the natives here fared rather better than their southern
          counterparts did at the hands of the Saxons, who, for example, sacked
          the Isle of Wight, such that not a native male Briton was left alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scotland was believed to have been founded in 843 AD, and eventually
          expanded its borders to the area of modern day Scotland. The early
          history of the new nation was marked with many conflicts with the
          English, and also the Vikings who invaded the north of Scotland. Today
          the Shetland Islands retain a strong Viking cultural identity. Another
          powerful impact on Scotland's story has been religion. Events leading
          up to the Scottish Reformation of 1560, including the destruction of
          the cathedral at St. Andrews the year before, had a strong impact on
          life in the country, and led to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland
          taking over from the Roman Catholic Church as the established state
          religion. It was a more strict form of Protestantism than the
          Anglicanism that developed in England, and was influenced by the
          teaching of Jean Calvin which had been brought back by John Knox.
          Religion would lead to many later political and military clashes, such
          as the Bishops' Wars that were part of the wider civil wars in
          England, Ireland and Scotland in the 17th century.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wars with the English would dominate Scottish history for hundreds of
          years until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when the King of Scots,
          James VI, inherited the English throne after the death of Queen
          Elizabeth I (who had executed his mother, Mary I, Queen of Scots).
          While this put an end to armed conflict, there were still conflicts
          between the Scottish and English parliaments on which monarch should
          succeed and various commercial disputes such as the ill-fated "Darien
          Scheme" to establish a Scottish colony in Panama. The disaster of the
          Darien scheme was due partly to incompetence and partly to
          interference from England, which feared competition with its own
          colonies. Almost a quarter of the money circulating in Scotland at the
          time was invested in the scheme, and its failure caused an economic
          catastrophe amongst the nobility of Scotland. This was one factor
          leading to the Act of Union.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1701 England passed an act that meant that if King William III's
          successor died without children, the Crown would be passed on to a
          protestant German prince. In response to this, the Scottish parliament
          passed a law saying that the next King of Scotland would not be a King
          of England also, effectively ending the 100 year personal union.
          England retaliated with a trade embargo that would only be lifted if
          Scotland and England united in a political union. England also offered
          to pay off all of Scotland's debts from the failed Darien Scheme.
          Thus, on May 1, 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain (it would not
          become the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" until the
          union with the Kingdom of Ireland in 1800) came into existence.
          Scotland and England retained their own religious, education, and
          legal systems (which is why these differ today). However, the union
          was very controversial, with the apparent bribing and promising of
          financial gain to the members of the Scottish Parliament (who were
          mostly nobility), and national poet Robert Burns famously saying that
          Scotland was "bought and sold for English gold". There were also many
          riots as the time and the decision was extremely unpopular with the
          general Scottish population. Despite the controversy, the Union
          provided a new stability and a climate in the 18th and 19th centuries
          in which commerce and new ways of thinking could flourish, and led to
          a major role for Scotland (and particularly its people) in the British
          Empire and the creation of the world we know today. Historian Simon
          Schama has written that "What began as a hostile merger, would end in
          a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ...
          it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European
          history."
