              The Swiss Army knife generally has a main spearpoint blade, as
              well as various tools, such as screwdrivers, a can opener, and
              many others. These attachments are stowed inside the handle of the
              knife through a pivot point mechanism. While the handle of the
              Swiss Army Knife is usually depicted in its traditional red color,
              other colors, textures, and shapes have appeared since 2006. Also
              since 2006, the handle of the Swiss Army Knife bears a Victorinox
              or Wenger "cross" logo or, for Swiss military issue knives, the
              coat of arms of Switzerland.

              Originating in Ibach, Switzerland, the Swiss Army knife was first
              produced in 1891 after the company, Karl Elsener, which later
              became Victorinox, won the contract to produce the Swiss Army's
              Modell 1890 knife from the previous German manufacturer. In 1893,
              the Swiss cutlery company Paul Boéchat & Cie, which later became
              Wenger, received its first contract from the Swiss military to
              produce model 1890 knives; the two companies split the contract
              for provision of the knives from 1908 until Victorinox acquired
              Wenger in 2005. A cultural icon of Switzerland, the design of the
              knife and its versatility have both led to worldwide recognition
